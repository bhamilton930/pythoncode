My dumping grounds for my python code.

I was a developer/script kiddie for years R.I.P - [1995 - 2015].

After working for a dotcom for a near lifetime, my group was laidoff, I got bitter and quit the biz. 

I then decided to take a different career path outside of IT, Web devel and backend system applications.

I've been out of the field for a decade+ and wanted to get back into it. Which lead me to this github and python repo.

This place is just me essentionally relearning how to code and in python after a 10+ year hiatus.
